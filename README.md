# Converter for Gqrx bookmarks
This code takes a file from http://www.eibispace.de/
as input and creates a list of lines that
can be used to add them to the bookmarks of 
Gqrx.

On Linux, you find these here
```$HOME/.config/gqrx/bookmarks.csv```

# Run the code
Currently, you have to execute the test method
```testE2E``` in class ProcessorTest.
Result lines are written to STDOUT.

Take these and add them to the end of the 
existing bookmarks file.
